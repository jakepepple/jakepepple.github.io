        <h1>This text is big dude</h1>
          <h2>This is still decently big</h2>
            <h3>We're getting a bit smaller now</h3>
              <h4>Why are you taking me out</h4>
                <h5>Scared of my big text</h5>

        <p>So now I'm gonna start writing some text on drums. I really enjoy playing drums,
        teaching drums, listening to drummers, and talking about drums. It's a relaxing activity,
        a therapeutic activity, and a creatively fulfilling activity. It also can release stress after
        a long day of work, dealing with kids, coding, etc...</p>
        
        <p>The modern drum kit was invented near the beginning of the 20th century, and took some 
        modifications along the way to get to its current form. Drums had a large part in determining
        the course of popular music in the 20th century, and beyond. When jazz drummers starting keeping
        a backbeat going through songs (snare drum played on the 2nd and 4th beats) the modern popular
        drum groove was born, and music would never be the same.</p>
        
        <p>Think about your favorite song, any song. Try listening to the drummer (or drum track). Notice
        how most of the drums coincide <i>with another instrument</i> (or another sound). <b>This isn't a coincidence!</b>
        Many drummers (or producers) use drums as the <em>rhythmic backbone</em> for building a song. The bass drum may
        coincide with the bass guitarist's line, or the hi-hat may mimic the guitar, or the snare drum may build
        with a synth in electronic music, etc. It all works together!</p>
